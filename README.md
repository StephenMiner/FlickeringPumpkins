This plugin adds a block that, after a period set in a config file, will switch between a carved pumpkin block and a jack-o-lantern block

Note that this is supposed to work with placing, breaking, and explosions, but pistons are not supported and will cause blocks to potentially be replaced since the pumpkin will just keep flickering from the position where the piston originally moved it from. 


To give yourself the special block, the command is /give-pumpkin or /gp. The permission is "flickerpumpkins.commands.give"

To reload changes made to the config, do /pumpkinreload or /preload. The permission is "flickerpumpkins.commands.reload"
